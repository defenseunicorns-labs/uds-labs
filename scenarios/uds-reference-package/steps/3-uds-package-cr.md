# Step 3 – The UDS Package CR

The `Package` CR is what makes a Zarf package a *UDS* package. Without it, your app deploys but gets no UDS-managed external access, network policies, SSO, or monitoring. The UDS Operator watches `kind: Package` resources and generates the supporting Kubernetes and Istio resources.

## Read the CR

```bash
cat chart/templates/uds-package.yaml
```

The CR has four major sections:

---

### `network.serviceMesh`

```yaml
serviceMesh:
  mode: ambient
```

UDS Core uses Istio **ambient mesh** — mTLS, traffic policy, and observability run at the node level via ztunnel rather than as per-pod sidecar containers. The practical effect: your pod shows `1/1` READY (not `2/2`) because no Istio proxy is injected. The mesh is still fully active; it's just invisible to the pod.

---

### `network.expose`

```yaml
expose:
  - service: reference-package
    selector:
      app: reference-package
    gateway: tenant
    host: reference-package
    port: 8080
    uptime:
      checks:
        paths:
          - /health
```

The UDS Operator reads this and creates an Istio `VirtualService` routing external HTTPS traffic from `reference-package.uds.dev` to your pod. The fields map to:
- `host: reference-package` → `reference-package.uds.dev` (domain suffix appended from cluster config)
- `gateway: tenant` → routes through the user-facing Istio ingress (use `admin` for internal dashboards like Grafana)
- `port: 8080` → the **container** port (matched to the Service's `targetPort`, not the Service port)
- `uptime.checks.paths` → Pepr creates uptime checks against `reference-package.uds.dev/health`

---

### `network.allow`

**Everything is default-deny.** UDS Core installs a cluster-wide deny policy that blocks all pod-to-pod traffic unless explicitly allowed. Every network flow must be declared here. The reference package declares:

| Rule | Direction | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `IntraNamespace` | Ingress + Egress | Communication between pods in the same namespace |
| Postgres | Egress | App → postgres-operator in the `postgres` namespace on port 5432 |
| Keycloak | Egress | App → Keycloak in `keycloak` namespace on port 8080 |
| Tenant gateway | Egress | App → tenant gateway for OIDC token validation |

The comment `# Custom rules for unanticipated scenarios` with `additionalNetworkAllow` shows how bundle operators can inject extra rules at deploy time via Helm overrides — without changing the package.

---

### `sso`

```yaml
sso:
  - name: Reference Package Login
    clientId: uds-reference-package
    secretName: reference-package-sso
    secretTemplate:
      KEYCLOAK_URL: "https://sso.{{ .Values.domain }}/realms/uds"
      KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID: "clientField(clientId)"
      KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET: "clientField(secret)"
```

When the UDS Operator reconciles this, it:
1. Registers a Keycloak OIDC client automatically (no manual Keycloak configuration)
2. Creates a Kubernetes Secret named `reference-package-sso` in the same namespace
3. Populates the secret using `secretTemplate` — `clientField(clientId)` resolves to the actual client ID, `clientField(secret)` to the generated client secret

Your app reads credentials from this secret. No hardcoded values, no manual Keycloak admin steps.

---

### `monitor`

```yaml
monitor:
  - selector:
      app: reference-package
    targetPort: 8080
    portName: http
    path: /metrics
    kind: ServiceMonitor
```

The UDS Operator creates a Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` targeting `/metrics` on your pod. UDS Core's Prometheus instance picks it up automatically. No manual ServiceMonitor creation needed.

## Compare to live cluster resources

The UDS Operator already generated VirtualServices for UDS Core itself:

```bash
uds zarf tools kubectl get virtualservices -A
```

You'll see VirtualServices for Keycloak (`sso.admin.uds.dev`), the admin gateway, and the tenant gateway — all generated from UDS Core's own Package CRs.

## Verify

```bash
uds zarf tools kubectl get virtualservices -A --no-headers | wc -l
```

Note the count. You'll verify it increases after deploy in step 5.
