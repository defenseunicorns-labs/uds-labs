# Step 2 – Bundle layer: dependencies at the right layer

This is the most common mistake ISVs make when first building UDS packages.

## The wrong way

Imagine a developer who needs Postgres. They add it directly to `zarf.yaml`:

```yaml
# DON'T DO THIS
components:
  - name: postgres-operator
    charts:
      - name: postgres-operator
        url: https://opensource.zalando.com/postgres-operator
        version: "1.15.1"
        namespace: postgres
  - name: my-app
    charts:
      - name: my-app
        localPath: chart/
        namespace: my-app
```

This breaks UDS composability in three ways:

1. **Version conflicts** — if two packages bundle different postgres-operator versions, the second deploy overwrites the first. No negotiation, no error.
2. **No bundle overrides** — bundle operators can't configure the operator (connection limits, storage class, instance count) at deploy time if it's buried inside a package.
3. **Operator duplication** — every app that needs Postgres brings its own operator. In a production cluster with 10 UDS packages, you get 10 postgres-operator deployments fighting each other.

## The right way: `bundle/uds-bundle.yaml`

```
cat bundle/uds-bundle.yaml
```

The bundle is the deployment unit that composes packages together. Infrastructure dependencies like `postgres-operator` live here — pulled from a registry at a pinned version, with full override capability exposed to the operator deploying the bundle.

The reference package itself (`path: ../`) is also listed as a package in the bundle. The bundle wires them together at deploy time via `overrides` — telling the reference package where to find its Postgres credentials, which SSO secret to use, and whether to enable monitoring.

## Inspect the Postgres credential adapter

```
cat chart/templates/postgres-secret.yaml
```

The application accepts one database connection string, while the Postgres Operator generates separate username and password fields. This chart uses Helm's `lookup` function during rendering to read that generated Secret and assemble the connection string.

That adapter demonstrates a real compatibility problem, but it is not the preferred pattern for every application. Rendering can race the operator because the generated Secret may not exist yet. If an application accepts separate fields, reference the operator-generated Secret directly with `secretKeyRef`. If it only accepts a connection string, use a bounded runtime adapter or init process that waits for the Secret and reports a clear failure.

## `uds run dev` deploys this bundle

```
cat tasks.yaml | grep -A5 "name: dev"
```

`uds run dev` reads `tasks.yaml` and deploys `bundle/uds-bundle.yaml` against the running cluster. This is the correct workflow for iterating on a package with its full dependency chain during development. You get postgres-operator + your app in one command, wired together exactly as they would be in production.

The `default` task (not used here) also provisions a fresh k3d cluster — useful in CI but unnecessary when UDS Core is already running.

## Verify

```
grep -r "postgres-operator" zarf.yaml; echo "exit: $?"
```

Postgres is not in `zarf.yaml`. Exit code 1 (not found) confirms the correct structure.
